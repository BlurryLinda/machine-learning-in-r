Education is the first step towards empowerment. With this in mind, Sparks of Africa established a highly professional Skill Acquisition, Empowerment & Development (SAED) Centre in Ilorin, Nigeria. The SAED Center is a unique program that imparts high-tech innovation training in multiple disciplines. The center will also run entrepreneurship programs for youth where they will learn to exploit their ideas and skills for professional endeavors. The SAED Center has the enormous capacity to cater to 1000 talented graduates in various fields. The expected outcome of this attempt is development of highly skilled, technically sound and more educated youngsters in Nigeria.
